# Project Details

## Project Description

This project aims to develop a career services platform that facilitates candidates and employers in the recruitment process. Candidates can create and update their portfolios, while employers can post job openings. The platform enables candidates to tailor their profiles according to market requirements and allows employers to find suitable candidates. Candidates/Students can view and apply for job postings, while employers can create and manage job posts, review candidate applications, and track the progress of their job offers. The system ensures high-security login credentials to protect user information. The project provides an opportunity for the development team to learn coding and web development skills while following agile practices, ensuring an iterative and collaborative approach to software development.

## Project Goal/Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop a career services platform while following agile practices, providing an opportunity for the development team to enhance their coding skills and gain hands-on experience in the software development lifecycle and processes. By adopting an agile approach, we aim to learn how to effectively collaborate, prioritize tasks, and deliver incremental updates. Throughout the project, the team will improve their proficiency in coding, database management, and web development technologies. By successfully completing this project, the team members will acquire valuable knowledge in software development, agile methodologies, and the intricacies of creating a scalable and secure online platform.

## Competitive Analysis
Competitive analysis plays a crucial role in the software engineering process. Before the launch of a product or a service, it is important to scope out solutions that already exist for your problem statement. A competitive analysis helps understand what works and what doesn’t among features offered by other solution providers in one's app domain. It helps you strategically design a superior experience that allows a product to stand out from the rest.
